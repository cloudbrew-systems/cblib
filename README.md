# CloudBrew Library
The core library of CloudBrew that does all the data distribution & reassembly as part of upload & download

# Prerequisites
RHEL 7+ OR CentOS 7+

# Motivation
Revelations by Edward Snowden of mass-scale data snoops. Yes, I advocate national security but not at the cost of compromising my privacy.

# Installation
Running "make" should work most of the time. If you want to cleanup, just run "make clean".
There are some other options as well, but that's beyond this README file.
Please refer to the make file for more information
